      abstract={Generative Design (GD) has evolved as a transformative design approach, employing advanced algorithms and AI
to create diverse and innovative solutions beyond traditional constraints. Despite its success, GD faces significant
challenges regarding the manufacturability of complex designs, often necessitating extensive manual modifications
due to limitations in standard manufacturing processes and the reliance on additive manufacturing, which is not ideal
for mass production. Our research introduces an innovative framework addressing these manufacturability concerns
by integrating constraints pertinent to die casting and injection molding into GD, through the utilization of 2D depth
images. This method simplifies intricate 3D geometries into manufacturable profiles, removing unfeasible features
such as non-manufacturable overhangs and allowing for the direct consideration of essential manufacturing aspects
like thickness and rib design. Consequently, designs previously unsuitable for mass production are transformed into
viable solutions. We further enhance this approach by adopting an advanced 2D generative model, which offer a more
efficient alternative to traditional 3D shape generation methods. Our results substantiate the efficacy of this framework,
demonstrating the production of innovative, and, importantly, manufacturable designs. This shift towards integrating
practical manufacturing considerations into GD represents a pivotal advancement, transitioning from purely inspira-
tional concepts to actionable, production-ready solutions. Our findings underscore usefulness and potential of GD
for broader industry adoption, marking a significant step forward in aligning GD with the demands of manufacturing
challenges.}
