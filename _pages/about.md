As a Ph. D. student in Mech. Eng. at KAIST, I am pursuing my passion for Generative Design for Manufacturing, applying deep learning techniques to optimize the shape and structure of mechanical components for mass production. I'm under the supervision of Prof. Namwoo Kang at [Smart Design Lab](http://www.smartdesignlab.org/index.html).

With experience as a data scientist at SLB (previously Schlumberger), I have developed and deployed machine learning models to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of oil and gas exploration and production. Before joining KAIST, I received my MSc degree in Data Science from University of Bath, UK, advised by Dr. Wenbin Li, and BEng degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Bristol, UK.
