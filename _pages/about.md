Hey there! This is Jihoon, a PhD student of [Smart Design Lab](http://www.smartdesignlab.org/index.html) at KAIST.
I'm interested in Generative Design, Text-to-3D, and Additive Manufacturing.
My research aim is to reduce the gap between product design and manufacturing in the field of generative design for engineering.
