As a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at KAIST, my driving passion is to transform Generative Design from a mere conceptual tool into a practical, efficient, and innovative solution for the manufacturing challenges of the future. Guided by the expertise of Prof. Namwoo Kang at [Smart Design Lab](http://www.smartdesignlab.org/index.html), I am pioneering the application of deep learning techniques to revolutionize the optimization of mechanical components, focusing on manufacturability, mass production, and crucially, mechanical performance.

With experience as a data scientist at [SLB (previously Schlumberger)](https://www.slb.com/), I have developed and deployed machine learning models to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of oil and gas exploration and production. Before joining KAIST, I received my [MSc degree in Data Science](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-2024/taught-postgraduate-courses/msc-data-science-with-professional-placement/) from University of Bath, UK, advised by [Dr. Wenbin Li](https://peringlab.org/), and [BEng degree in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2024/mechanical-engineering/beng-mechanical-engineering/) from University of Bristol, UK.
